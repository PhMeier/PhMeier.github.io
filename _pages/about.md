I am a Ph.D student in Computational Linguistics at the Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf under the supervision of
Laura Kallmeyer, Stefan Dietze and Katarina Boland.
I am currently employed in the [NewOrder](https://neworder-project.github.io
) project, where I work on the analysis of scientific online discourse.
My research interests are writing styles of humans and machines, generalizability and explainability.
